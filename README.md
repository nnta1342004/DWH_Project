# Project: Building a Data Warehouse with Apache Ecosystem

## 🌐 Overview

![image.png](images/image.png)

This repository demonstrates how to **design, implement, and operate a modern data warehouse** using a suite of open-source Apache tools. 

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

## 📐 Architecture

A **Data Warehouse** is a centralized repository designed to aggregate data from multiple sources, enabling advanced analytics, reporting, and BI. This project follows a **multi-layered approach**:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw ingested data.
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and transformed data.
- **Gold Layer**: Business-ready views and aggregated metrics for analytics.

## ⚒️ Setup

This project requires several Apache services, each running under dedicated users and groups.

For a smooth setup, use a service account that:

- Has permission to access **Hive** and write to the Hive Data Warehouse.
- Can execute **Spark** jobs via `spark-submit`.
1. **Setup PostgreSQL and load initial data:**
    
    ```
    bash src/initial/load.sh
    ```
    
2. **Create Hive tables (Bronze, Silver, Gold):**
    
    ```
    spark-submit src/bronze/init_bronze.py
    spark-submit src/silver/init_silver.py
    spark-submit src/gold/init_gold.py
    ```
    
3. **Run ETL pipeline via Airflow:**
    - Start Airflow webserver and scheduler.
    
    ```
    airflow scheduler
    airflow api-server -p 8080
    ```
    
    - Trigger or schedule the DAG in `etl_dag.py` .

4. **Practice query**

Once the Gold schema are ready, you can:

- Use **HiveQL** in the Hive CLI to run analytical queries on the Data Warehouse.
- Or use **Trino** with the Hive connector for faster, interactive querying. Some queries I used is defined in `trino/test.sql`

## 💡Data Pipeline

---

### 1. Data Source & Modeling

This project uses **dimensional modeling** with a **Star Schema** to organize data for analytics.

- **Source Systems:** The raw source data is located in `/data/raw_data` and comes from two systems:
    - **CRM** – Holds sales transactions, product details, and customer information.
    - **ERP** – Contains product categories, customer attributes (e.g., birthdate), and location data.
    - To practice **incremental extraction**, I have added a column named `src_update_at` to track the time when data was generated in source system.
- **Data Modeling (Star Schema):**
    - **Fact Table:** `fact_sales` – Stores sales transactions with metrics like sales amount, quantity, and price.
    - **Dimension Tables:**
        - `dim_customers` – Contains customer demographics and profile information.
        - `dim_products` – Holds product attributes, categories, and cost details.

This structure enables efficient analytical queries by linking facts to descriptive dimensions.

### 2. Data Extraction

This project implements **two batch extraction approaches** using **Spark (PySpark).**

- **Full Extraction** – Initial one-time extraction of all data.
- **Incremental Extraction** – Daily extraction of new or updated data, determined using the `src_update_at` column.

The extraction code is defined in `src/bronze/extract.py`

Extracted data is stored in the **Bronze Layer** of the Data Warehouse. The Bronze Layer is defined in `/src/bronze/create-bronze-schema.hql` 

To run the ingestion:

```bash
spark-submit src/bronze/extract.py
```

When the extraction is finished, the ingestion program also writes execution metadata into the `job_info` and `job_log` tables, stored in the source database. For example:

```
select config_id, job_name, source_table, destination_table, load_type from  job_config limit 20;
```

### 3. Data Transformation & Data Load

Data transformation is performed using **PySpark** and **SparkSQL**, the data will be read from Bronze Layer (all raw data) then applying transformation techniques such as:

- Data cleansing
- Deduplication
- Derived column creation

Transformation scripts are located in the `src/silver/` directory.

To execute a specific transformation, for example for `crm_cust_info`, run:

```bash
spark-submit src/silver/transform_crm_cust_info.py
```

The cleaned and validated data is then **overwritten** into the **Silver Layer**. The Silver Layer is defined in `/src/silver/create-silver-schema.hql` 

---

### 4. Data Serving

- To support **business analytics**, the **Gold Layer** is built with a **Star Schema.**
- The Gold Layer is defined in `/src/gold/create-gold-schema.hql`
- Transformed data from the Silver Schema is inserted into the Gold Schema.

Once the Gold Layer is ready, analytical queries can be executed using **Hive CLI** with HiveQL or **Trino** against the **Hive Data Warehouse**.

### 5. Data orchestration

This project uses **Apache Airflow** to orchestrate the ETL workflow.

The DAG definition is located at: `dags/etl_dag.py`

It coordinates the extraction, transformation, and loading processes across the **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers, ensuring tasks are executed in the correct order and on schedule.
